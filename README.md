# AdvancedText2SpeechApp
**The objective of this project is to develop an application that allows to edit and transform documents to
audio. The documents may be in various formats. Specifically the application supports at least Microsoft
Word (.docx) and Excel documents (.xlsx). For privacy and security reasons the contents of the
documents may be encoded with different encoding mechanisms. The target users of the application
may be people who have reading problems or visually impaired people. The application consists of a
graphical user interface, a back-end that enables the text editing process and the part that transforms
text to speech, which will be based on external text to speech libraries.**
