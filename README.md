documents may be encoded with different encoding mechanisms. The target users of the application
may be people who have reading problems or visually impaired people. The application consists of a
graphical user interface, a back-end that enables the text editing process and the part that transforms
text to speech, which will be based on external text to speech libraries. nterface. The program is packaged in an .exe file.**
